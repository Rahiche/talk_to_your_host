This app was used as a part of a talk to illustrate how to leverage native APIs within a Flutter environment.


### Features

The application includes the following demos:

- Blurhash: Transition Example
- Image Processing: Blur
- Blurhash Using Different Methods

### Directory Structure:

The project is structured as follows:

```css
lib/
├── platform_channels/
│   └── blurhash_decoder.dart
├── samples/
│   ├── blurhash-transition/
│   │   └── images.dart
│   ├── blurhash_benchmark/
│   │   └── blurhash_demo.dart
│   └── image_processing/
│       └── gaussian_blur.dart
```

## Implementation Notes
### Gaussian Blur
🔴 The Gaussian blur implemented in Dart uses a different algorithm compared to the Rust implementation. While the Dart version can be optimized, it was intentionally kept as-is to showcase existing methods without any modifications or optimizations. This decision was made to demonstrate the use of readily available tools and libraries.


### Blurhash Example
🟠 Similarly, the Blurhash example leverages existing methods and libraries without any forking or optimization. The goal was to present the functionality as it is available in the current ecosystem.
